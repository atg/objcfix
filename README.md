# objcfix -- find and add missing declarations

**objcfix** is a small tool that scans your project, identifies any missing method declarations, class declarations, #imports, etc, and offers to add them.

## Why?

Correct @interface declarations are important to ensure correct code is generated by the compiler. While forgetting to declare a pointer-valued method is unlikely to cause trouble, methods that take or return structs, floats, small integers, etc can give incorrect results if not properly declared before use. Having correct @interfaces is even more important under ARC.

But writing header files is also *tediously boring* and a *complete waste of time* â€“ nearly all languages in existence (certainly those designed in the last 20 years) get by fine without them.

**objcfix** is a simple script that does this grunt work, without human interaction.

## Requirements

**objcfix** requires Python 2.7 which is included by default on Lion.

## Licence

**objcfix** is licensed under the [WTFPL](http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/). The terms are as follows:
